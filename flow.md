#### Heroku Flow - Continuous delivery

**App-centric continuous delivery, optimized for developers**


Heroku Flow brings together:

 - Heroku Pipelines
 - Review Apps
 - Heroku CI 
 - GitHub integrations 

 into an easy-to-use structured workflow for continuous delivery.

**Professional workflow in seconds**

Organize your pipeline by connecting your GitHub repo, and then automatically or manually placing your Heroku apps in dev, staging or production environments. 

Simultaneously develop features on dev branches that are reflected by disposable review apps, run tests on every push to GitHub with Heroku CI, merge pull requests, auto deploy to staging, and control who promotes to production.

**Complete visualization of code delivery**

Always know where a particular feature is on the path to production with the real-time Pipelines overview in the Heroku Dashboard. 

The Pipelines overview provides a single page view of the current relationships between apps, giving your team the state of development across all your environments. 

With Heroku CI you can see every test run resulting from a push to GitHub.

**Better quality, tighter iterations**

For every open Pull Request, Heroku can spin up a complete disposable environment called a **Review App** on a unique URL. 

Every push to a branch in GitHub triggers Heroku CI to run tests. Now everyone can contribute to feature testing early in the product life cycle for speedier decisions and better quality. You can keep staging and production environments identical to catch flaws before your users do.

**Faster releases, easy collaboration**

When combined with Heroku Pipelines, Review Apps and GitHub Integration, Heroku Teams and ChatOps make it even easier to embrace continuous delivery. With Heroku Teams members with the right permissions can collaborate on changes within a Pipeline. Heroku ChatOps makes communication much easier by posting notifications of code changes and deployments associated with a Pipeline in Slack. Team members can see Heroku CI results, deploy to apps in a pipeline, and much more from Slack.
